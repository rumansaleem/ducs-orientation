DUCS was instrumental in helping me get multiple admits. I will be joining **McGill University** this year. I also received admits from University of Minnesota, University of British Columbia, University of Chicago, University of Melbourne, University of San Franciso, and Concordia University. I will always be grateful to the faculty and staff for mentoring me at every step of the admission process. I must admit that my application wouldn’t be as strong without their inputs and wonderful support. The teachers at DUCS give utmost priority to their students. 

I am fortunate that I was mentored by Vasudha Ma’am, Naveen Sir and Sharanjit Ma’am who helped me with my recommendations. They knew the intricate details of the process and acted as experienced pilots who helped me achieved my dreams.
