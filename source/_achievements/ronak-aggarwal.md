I am fortunate enough to be a part of DUCS. DUCS provided me so many opportunities to grow myself towards my career. I will be representing DUCS at **Technical University of Berlin, Germany**. I would be attending a Summer School on Sustainable Energy Future there. 

I am thankful to faculty who provided me support at every step of this success. Seeking to learn and explore a lot of things there and to add something to my knowledge.
