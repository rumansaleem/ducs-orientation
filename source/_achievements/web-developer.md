I am a passionate full-stack web developer. I have been learning web development since past two years and still learning.

- I have developed a registration and quizzing portal for **Sankalan 2019**.
- I participated in Smart India Hackathon as a  part of the team *Codeoysters*.
- I have won **1st Prize** in *Web Development* at BVP College, Paschim Vihar in 2019.
- I have won **1st Prize** in *Web Design* at PGDAV College, Delhi University in 2018.

Be it Digital marketing, E-Commerce, or a SaaS application, Web developers are required everywhere. Being a web developer you can cater to the world even with just a single attractive page on the web. 

If you too are a passionate web developer and you think you can contribute to the development of sanklan portal, feel free to contact me on twitter or through email. Or, even if you have just begun learning web development don't hesitate to contact me.
